# Study Haskell session 01-12-2018 

## Topics

- Began discussing ADTs
- `Either` as a (kind of) sum type
- Records: [`NamedFieldPuns`](https://limperg.de/ghc-extensions/#namedfieldpuns) pragma, pattern matching
- Pattern matching with `case` keyword
- Making a type for errors (`Error`)
- De-sugaring `do` notation

## Try at home

- Write tests for `readNumbers_do`; both property tests and unit tests would be good
- Read about `Maybe` type

## References

- Workout for lists:
